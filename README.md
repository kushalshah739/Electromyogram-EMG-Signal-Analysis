# Electromyogram-EMG-Signal-Analysis
The human body is one large energy source. It creates electrical signals in response to outside sources, and these electrical signals can be measured with sensors. An EMG signal is the summation of all action potentials in a muscle group, which in other terms means it is the summation of all electrical signals. EMG signals, for the purpose of this lab, are created by contracting forearm muscles in an isometric fashion.

We compare the force output to the EMG signals and explore the relationship between the exerted force and the electrical inputs to those muscles. To compare, there are many calculations/methodologies which can be used including variance, dynamic range, mean squared, etc.
