# Electromyogram-EMG-Signal-Analysis
The human body is one large energy source. It creates electrical signals in response to outside sources, and these electrical signals can be measured with sensors. An EMG signal is the summation of all action potentials in a muscle group, which in other terms means it is the summation of all electrical signals.
